Main PSP Repo for building the whole `PSP Development` environment in your local machine.

This program will automatically build and install the whole compiler and other tools used in the creation of homebrew software for the Sony PlayStation PortableÂ® videogame system.

## What these scripts do

These scripts download (`git clone`) and install:

-   [psptoolchain](https://github.com/pspdev/psptoolchain "psptoolchain")
-   [pspsdk](https://github.com/pspdev/pspsdk "pspsdk")
-   [psp-pkgconfig](https://github.com/pspdev/psp-pkgconfig "psp-pkgconfig")
-   [psp-packages](https://github.com/pspdev/psp-packages "psp-packages")
-   [psplinkusb](https://github.com/pspdev/psplinkusb "psplinkusb")
-   [ebootsigner](https://github.com/pspdev/ebootsigner "ebootsigner")

## Requirements

1.  Install gcc/clang, make, cmake, patch, git, texinfo, flex, bison, gettext, wget, gsl, gmp, mpfr, mpc, libusb, readline if you don't have those.

2.  _Optional._ If you are upgrading from the previous version of the PSPDEV environment, it is highly recommended to remove the content of the PSPDEV folder before upgrade. This is a necessary step after the major toolchain upgrade.
```bash
sudo rm -rf $PSPDEV
```

3.  Ensure that you have enough permissions for managing PSPDEV location (default to `/usr/local/pspdev`, but you can use a different path). PSPDEV location MUST NOT have spaces or special characters in its path! PSPDEV should be an absolute path. On Unix systems, if the command `mkdir -p $PSPDEV` fails for you, you can set access for the current user by running commands:
```bash
export PSPDEV=/usr/local/pspdev
sudo mkdir -p $PSPDEV
sudo chown -R $USER: $PSPDEV
```

4.  Add this to your login script (example: `~/.bash_profile`)
    **Note:** Ensure that you have full access to the PSPDEV path. You can change the PSPDEV path with the following requirements: only use absolute paths, don't use spaces, only use Latin characters.
```bash
export PSPDEV=/usr/local/pspdev
export PATH=$PATH:$PSPDEV/bin
```

5.  Run build-all.sh
```bash
./build-all.sh
```

## Docker generation

This repo also uses CI/CD to create a docker image called `pspdev/pspdev:latest` per change. This is useful if you're a developer that wants to create/port an application to the PSP. You can compile your project using this docker image.

## Extra steps

If you want, you can _JUST_ install the extra dependencies as `psplinkusb and ebootsigner`. To achieve this execute
```bash
./build-extra.sh
```

### macOS

If you download the pre-built macOS binaries and get a security error such as _`"pspsh" cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.`_, you can remove the quarantine attribute by running:
```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine path/to/prebuilt/pspdev
```
